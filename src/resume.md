# Short and Sweet
I am a first year C.S. Honours student at the University of Alberta who has been immersed
in programming for nearly the past decade. I started trying to teach myself around the age
of 8 or 9 and over the years I've ended up with a good amount of experience in a variety of
different programming languages and in a few sub disciplines of C.S.

If you make it to the end I have something interesting for you.

# Some of the more interesting things I've tried/done.
- I made a custom game engine for my 2d game in C++ in seventh grade.
- A small program to simulate the behaviour of a enigma machine.
- Tried writing a neural net from scratch in C, I got feedforward working, but needed to consult
some tutorials to try to understand the math behind backpropagation. In the end it worked but
I had no understanding of what was going on.
- Tried writing some bear metal code for a Rasbberry PI 3 around 9th grade, but I had no idea how
software actually interacted with hardware so that failed.
- In tenth grade I started playing around with cybersec and tensorflow. I ended up finding an xss
vulnerability in soe random flashcard app on the internet and sent them an email about it.
- I tried writing a compiler to take C and convert it into scratch. Lexing and parsing worked fine,
but I hit a wall when I got to optimization and code generation. (I should have just used LLVM).
- In 11th grade I wrote a couple libraries over summmer break for fun: one to parse digits in C and
a second in Rust for permutation using iterators which is on crates.io.
- Two summers ago I did a handful of small commits to a variety of open source Rust projects: (commits here)
- Me and a couple friends did the GMTK game jam last year aswell.
- I did the senior division of the CCC in twelfth grade and the junior division of the ACPC recently
and my team got 2nd.
- I wrote a stopwatch app in Kotlin with which triggers using motion detection.
